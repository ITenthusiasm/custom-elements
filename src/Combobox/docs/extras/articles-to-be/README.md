# Articles to Be

Welcome! This folder contains a collection of philosophical thoughts on frontend development that I didn't quite think fit anywhere else. These could probably be blog posts (and maybe some of them now are), but it's simplest to get everything written down in Markdown first. If I ever get the opportunity to convert some (or all) of these files into blogs, I likely will. But in the meantime, the content will remain here (and hopefully make it easier for developers to view philosophical discussions without having to leave GitHub).
